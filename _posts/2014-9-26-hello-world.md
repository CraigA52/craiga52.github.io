Hi.  My name is Andrew, this is my personal blog - mostly to practice writing and post photos from trips and projects.  I've learned a lot from the personal blogs of many people in business, web development, and design.

## What I'm Doing
Currently I am running a startup which designed a new way of moving patients during an emergency. We are growing rapidly around the world, it's a simple and extremely effective solution for a very difficult challenge. Check it out at [Rex Rapid Extraction](http://rexems.com). I'm also involved in a number of other startups as an investor and advisor in between volunteering as a Paramedic in several places and coaching high performance athletes.

## This Site

The blog is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com) and uses a static blogging software called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  I forked over a Jekyll build from Barry Clark called [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) which is simple and works great.
