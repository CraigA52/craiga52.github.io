We recently spent some time on the Island of Hawaii.  It's an amazing place, filled with unique and fragile landscapes, volcanos, waterfalls, and unbelievable view of the stars.

Thank you to the Canon 5D Mark III, and it's strong low-light capabilities, we got a great shot inside the K朝lauea Crater at night.
